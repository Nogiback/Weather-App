# Weather-App

[Javascript - Weather App Project - The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app)

The purpose of this project was to build a simple weather web application using asynchronous JS (eg. Promises or Async/Await). The project also required the use of the weatherAPI to fetch/call information based on user input.
